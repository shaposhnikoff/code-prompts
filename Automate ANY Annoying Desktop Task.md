I have a repetitive task I do on my computer and I want you to automate it for me. I'm not a developer, so I need you to handle everything and explain it simply.

Here's the task I want to automate:
[Describe what you do manually — be specific about the steps you take, where your files are, what the end result looks like]

How often I do this:
[Daily / Weekly / Whenever X happens / etc.]

Before you build anything:

1. **Repeat it back to me** — Describe what you think I'm asking for in your own words so I can confirm you've got it right.

2. **Ask clarifying questions** — What else do you need to know? Don't guess on important details like file locations, naming conventions, or edge cases.

3. **Propose your approach** — Tell me in plain language:
   - What you're going to build
   - How it will work
   - What I'll need to do to run it (the simpler the better)
   - Any limitations or things it won't handle

4. **Wait for my approval** — Don't start building until I say go.

When you build it:
- Keep it as simple as possible
- Add comments explaining what each part does (in case I want to tweak it later)
- Test it with a small example first before running it on everything

When you're done, give me:
- Clear instructions on how to run it
- How to customize it if my needs change slightly
- What to check if something goes wrong

Assume I've never run a script before. Walk me through it like I'm brand new to this.
