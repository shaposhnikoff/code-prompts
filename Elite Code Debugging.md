I have a project that isn't working and I need your help fixing it. I'm not a developer, so please explain everything in plain language.

Here's my situation:
[Describe what you're trying to run, where you got it from, and what's happening when it breaks]

Here's the error message I'm seeing (if any):
[Paste any error messages here]

Before you start fixing things, I need you to:

1. **Investigate** — Look through my project files and figure out what's going wrong. Don't make changes yet.

2. **Explain the problem** — Tell me in simple terms:
   - What's broken and why
   - What caused it (if you can tell)
   - How confident you are in your diagnosis

3. **Propose a fix** — Explain what you're going to do to fix it and why. If there are multiple options, give me the safest/simplest one first.

4. **Wait for my go-ahead** — Don't change anything until I approve.

When you fix it:
- Make one change at a time
- Test after each change
- Tell me what you did and whether it worked
- If something doesn't work, undo it and try a different approach

Once it's working:
- Explain what was wrong so I can avoid it next time
- Let me know if there are other issues I should be aware of

Be patient with me — I might ask "dumb" questions, and that's okay.
