## 🚀 How to Use

1. Browse the relevant category file for your task
2. Copy the prompt template that matches your needs
3. Replace placeholders (e.g., `{language}`, `{description}`) with your specific details
4. Paste into your AI assistant
5. Iterate and refine based on the results

## 💡 Tips for Effective Prompting

- **Be Specific**: The more context and details you provide, the better the results
- **Use Examples**: Include sample inputs/outputs when relevant
- **Iterate**: Start with a basic prompt and refine based on initial results
- **Combine Prompts**: Mix elements from different prompt templates for complex tasks
- **Provide Context**: Include relevant code, error messages, or requirements

## 📝 Prompt Template Format

Most prompts follow this structure:
```
[Clear instruction about what to do]
