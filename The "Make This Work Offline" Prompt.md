I have a web app or tool that only works when I'm connected to the internet. I want you to modify it so it works offline too. I'm not a developer, so explain everything in plain language.

Here's what my project does:
[Describe your app — what it is, what it does, what features it has]

How I use it:
[On my phone / In a browser / On my desktop / etc.]

What I need to work offline:
[Everything / Just certain features / Specific parts like: viewing data, adding entries, basic functions, etc.]

Before you start:

1. **Explore my project** — Look through my files and understand how it currently works, especially what relies on being online.

2. **Tell me what's possible** — Explain in simple terms:
   - What can realistically work offline
   - What will always need internet (and why)
   - How data will be handled when I'm offline vs. online

3. **Explain the approach** — Tell me:
   - How the offline version will store data locally
   - What happens when I go back online (does it sync automatically, do I need to do something, could there be conflicts?)
   - Any limitations I should expect

4. **Flag potential issues** — Let me know if:
   - Some features might behave differently offline
   - There's a risk of losing data or creating duplicates
   - The offline version will be more limited than I might expect

5. **Wait for my approval** — Don't change anything until I understand and agree to the plan.

When you build it:
- Make changes in small steps and test each one
- Show me how to test that offline mode actually works
- Explain what you're doing as you go

When you're done, give me:
- How to use the app when I'm offline
- How syncing works when I reconnect
- What to do if something goes wrong (conflicts, failed syncs, etc.)
- Any new limitations I need to know about

Make sure I don't lose any data in the process. That's my biggest concern.
