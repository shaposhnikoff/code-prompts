# Performance Optimization Prompts

## General Performance Optimization
```
Optimize this {language} code for performance:
{paste code}

Current performance issue:
{describe issue}

Please:
- Identify bottlenecks
- Suggest optimizations
- Provide optimized code
- Explain performance gains
```

## Algorithm Optimization
```
Optimize this algorithm:
{paste algorithm}

Current complexity: {time and space}
Target: {desired performance}

Suggest:
- Better algorithm approach
- Data structure changes
- Complexity analysis of new approach
```

## Database Query Optimization
```
Optimize this database query:
{paste query}

Issues:
- {slow execution time}
- {high resource usage}

Provide:
- Optimized query
- Index recommendations
- Query execution plan analysis
- Expected performance improvement
```

## Memory Optimization
```
Reduce memory usage in this code:
{paste code}

Current memory profile:
{describe memory usage}

Suggest:
- Memory-efficient alternatives
- Object pooling opportunities
- Lazy loading strategies
- Resource cleanup improvements
```

## Frontend Performance
```
Optimize the performance of this {React/Vue/Angular} component:
{paste component}

Issues:
- {rendering performance}
- {bundle size}
- {load time}

Suggest optimizations for:
- Re-rendering
- Code splitting
- Lazy loading
- Asset optimization
```

## API Response Time
```
Reduce response time for this API endpoint:
{paste endpoint code}

Current response time: {time}
Target: {target time}

Optimize:
- Query efficiency
- Caching strategy
- Data processing
- Serialization
```

## Caching Strategy
```
Design a caching strategy for:
{describe system/component}

Consider:
- Cache invalidation
- Cache levels (application, database, CDN)
- TTL strategies
- Cache warming
- Cache consistency
```

## Load Testing
```
Create a load testing plan for:
{describe system}

Test scenarios:
- {scenario 1}
- {scenario 2}

Include:
- Performance metrics to measure
- Load patterns
- Success criteria
- Bottleneck identification strategy
```
