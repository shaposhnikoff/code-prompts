# Refactoring Prompts

## General Refactoring
```
Refactor this {language} code to improve:
- Readability
- Maintainability
- Performance
- Testability

Current code:
{paste code}

Please provide the refactored version with explanations.
```

## Extract Function
```
This function is too long and does too much:
{paste function}

Please break it down into smaller, focused functions with clear responsibilities.
```

## Remove Code Duplication
```
I have duplicate code in these functions:
{paste functions}

Please refactor to eliminate duplication using appropriate techniques (helper functions, inheritance, composition, etc.).
```

## Simplify Conditional Logic
```
This conditional logic is complex and hard to follow:
{paste code with complex conditionals}

Please simplify it while maintaining the same behavior.
```

## Apply Design Pattern
```
Refactor this code to use the {design pattern name} pattern:
{paste code}

Explain why this pattern is appropriate and how it improves the code.
```

## Improve Naming
```
Review and improve the naming in this code:
{paste code}

Suggest better names for:
- Variables
- Functions
- Classes
- Constants
Follow {language} naming conventions.
```

## Modernize Code
```
Update this legacy {language} code to use modern features:
{paste legacy code}

Use:
- Latest language features
- Current best practices
- Modern libraries/frameworks
Maintain backward compatibility where necessary.
```

## Reduce Complexity
```
This code has high cyclomatic complexity:
{paste code}

Please refactor to reduce complexity and improve maintainability.
```
