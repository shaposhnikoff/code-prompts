# Architecture and Design Prompts

## System Design
```
Design a system for {describe the problem/requirement}.

Requirements:
- {functional requirement 1}
- {functional requirement 2}
- {non-functional requirement 1}
- {non-functional requirement 2}

Provide:
- High-level architecture
- Component breakdown
- Technology recommendations
- Data flow
- Scalability considerations
```

## Database Schema
```
Design a database schema for {describe the domain}.

Entities:
- {entity 1}
- {entity 2}
- {entity 3}

Provide:
- Table structures
- Relationships
- Indexes
- Constraints
- Normalization considerations
```

## Microservices Design
```
Design a microservices architecture for {describe the system}.

Services needed:
- {service 1}
- {service 2}
- {service 3}

Include:
- Service boundaries
- Communication patterns
- Data management strategy
- Service discovery
- Error handling
```

## API Design
```
Design a RESTful API for {describe the domain}.

Resources:
- {resource 1}
- {resource 2}
- {resource 3}

Include:
- Endpoint structure
- HTTP methods
- Request/response formats
- Status codes
- Versioning strategy
- Authentication approach
```

## Design Pattern Selection
```
Recommend design patterns for:
{describe the problem}

Context:
{provide context}

Suggest:
- Appropriate patterns
- Why each pattern fits
- Implementation approach
- Tradeoffs
```

## Class Design
```
Design classes for {describe the domain model}.

Responsibilities:
- {responsibility 1}
- {responsibility 2}

Consider:
- SOLID principles
- Encapsulation
- Inheritance vs composition
- Interface design
```

## Architecture Review
```
Review this architecture design:
{describe or paste architecture}

Evaluate:
- Scalability
- Maintainability
- Security
- Performance
- Cost efficiency
- Technology choices
Suggest improvements.
```

## Migration Strategy
```
Design a migration strategy from:
Current: {describe current system}
Target: {describe target system}

Include:
- Migration phases
- Data migration approach
- Rollback strategy
- Risk mitigation
- Testing strategy
- Timeline estimate
```
