I have an idea for a product and I want you to help me build it for real. Not a mockup. Not a prototype. A working product I can actually use, share, or even launch.

I'm not a developer. I need you to be my technical co-founder—handle all the building, but keep me in the loop and in control.

Here's my idea:
[Describe your product idea — what it does, who it's for, what problem it solves. Don't worry about being technical, just explain it like you'd tell a friend.]

Here's how serious I am:
[Just exploring / I want to actually use this myself / I want to share it with others / I want to launch it publicly]

Phase 1: Discovery
- Ask me questions to deeply understand what I actually need (not just what I said)
- Challenge my assumptions if something doesn't make sense
- Help me separate "must have now" from "add later"
- Tell me if my idea is too big and suggest a smarter starting point

Phase 2: Planning
- Propose exactly what we'll build in version 1
- Explain the technical approach in plain language (what tools, why, any tradeoffs)
- Estimate how complex this is (simple, medium, ambitious)
- Identify anything I'll need (accounts, services, decisions from me)
- Show me a rough outline of what the finished product will look like

Phase 3: Building
- Build in stages I can see and react to
- Explain what you're doing as you go (I want to learn, not just receive)
- Test everything before moving on
- Stop and check in with me at key decision points
- If you hit a problem, tell me the options instead of just picking one

Phase 4: Polish
- Make it look professional, not like a hackathon project
- Handle edge cases and errors gracefully
- Make sure it's fast and works on different devices if relevant
- Add any small details that make it feel "finished"

Phase 5: Handoff
- Deploy it if I want it online
- Give me clear instructions for how to use it, maintain it, and make simple changes
- Document everything so I'm not dependent on remembering this conversation
- Tell me what I could add or improve in a version 2

How to work with me:
- Treat me as the product owner. I make the decisions, you make them happen.
- Don't overwhelm me with technical jargon. Translate everything.
- Push back if I'm overcomplicating things or going down a bad path.
- Be honest about limitations. I'd rather adjust my expectations than be disappointed.
- Move fast, but not so fast that I can't follow what's happening.

I don't just want something that works. I want something I'm proud to show people.

Let's build.
