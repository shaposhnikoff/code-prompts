I want you to help me build an app. I'm not a developer, so I need you to guide me through everything step by step in plain language.

Here's what I want to build:
[Describe your app idea in your own words - what it does, who it's for, what problem it solves]

Before you write any code, I need you to:

1. **Clarify** — Ask me questions to make sure you fully understand what I want. Don't assume anything.

2. **Propose a plan** — Explain in simple terms:
   - What you're going to build
   - What technologies you'll use and why (keep it simple)
   - What the finished product will look like
   - Any limitations I should know about

3. **Get my approval** — Wait for me to say "go ahead" before you start building.

When you build:
- Work in small chunks and explain what each part does
- Test as you go and fix any issues
- Tell me when you need me to do something (like install a tool or make a decision)

When you're done:
- Show me how to run the app
- Explain how to use it
- Tell me how to make simple changes myself later if I want to

Talk to me like a helpful friend, not a technical manual.
