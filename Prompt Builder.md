I want you to help me create a reusable prompt for Claude Code. I'm not sure how to write prompts that get good results, so I need you to interview me and build one for me.

Here's roughly what I want to use Claude Code for:
[Describe the type of task in your own words — doesn't need to be detailed yet]

Before you write the prompt:

1. **Interview me** — Ask me questions one or two at a time to understand:
   - What I'm actually trying to accomplish
   - My skill level (total beginner, some experience, etc.)
   - How I want Claude Code to communicate with me
   - Any specific requirements or preferences I have
   - How reusable I need this prompt to be (one-time vs. something I'll use often)

2. **Identify the type of task** — Tell me what category this falls into (building something, fixing something, automating something, learning, etc.) and whether there are proven approaches for this kind of prompt.

3. **Draft the prompt** — Write a first version and explain why you structured it the way you did.

4. **Get my feedback** — Ask me what I'd change, what's missing, or what feels off. Revise until I'm happy.

The final prompt should:
- Be copy-paste ready
- Have clear placeholders [like this] for the parts I'll fill in each time
- Include instructions that get Claude Code to work the way I prefer
- Be written in plain language I can easily understand and tweak later

Don't rush this. A good prompt saves me hours later.
