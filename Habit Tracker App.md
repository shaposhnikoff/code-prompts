I want you to build me a personal habit tracker. I'm not a developer, so handle all the technical stuff and explain things in plain language.

Here are the habits I want to track:
[List your habits — e.g., drink water, exercise, read, meditate, take medication, etc.]

How I want to track them:
[Daily / Some daily, some weekly / Certain days only / etc.]

Where I'll use this:
[On my phone / On my computer / Both / etc.]

Features I care about:

Must have:
- [ ] Simple way to mark habits complete
- [ ] See my current streaks
- [ ] View my history

Nice to have (check any that matter to you):
- [ ] Reminders or notifications
- [ ] Weekly or monthly summary
- [ ] Visual progress (charts, graphs, calendars)
- [ ] Different habits for different days
- [ ] Notes or mood tracking alongside habits
- [ ] Export my data
- [ ] Multiple habit categories
- [ ] Dark mode
- [ ] Other: [describe]

Before you build:

1. **Confirm what I need** — Repeat back what you're going to build so I know we're on the same page. Ask me questions if anything is unclear.

2. **Propose how it will work** — Tell me in simple terms:
   - What it will look like
   - How I'll use it day to day
   - Where my data will be stored
   - Whether I can access it from multiple devices

3. **Keep it simple** — Start with the essentials. We can add more features later. I'd rather have something clean that works than something complicated I won't use.

4. **Wait for my approval** — Don't start building until I say the plan sounds right.

When you build:
- Show me progress as you go
- Let me give feedback early so we don't have to redo things
- Test it before calling it done

When it's finished, give me:
- How to use it (the basics)
- How to add or change habits later
- How my data is saved (and how to back it up)
- Ideas for features we could add next if I want

Make it something I'll actually want to open every day.
