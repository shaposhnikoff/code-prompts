I have a project that works on my computer and I want to put it online so other people can use it. I'm not a developer, so I need you to handle the technical parts and walk me through anything I need to do.

Here's what my project is:
[Describe your project — what it does, what type it is if you know (website, web app, API, tool, etc.)]

What I want:
[A public link anyone can access / A private link I can share with specific people / Something else]

Before you do anything:

1. **Check my project** — Look through my files and make sure it's ready to be deployed. Tell me if anything needs to be fixed or changed first.

2. **Recommend a hosting option** — Explain in plain language:
   - Where you think I should deploy this and why
   - Whether it's free or paid (and roughly how much)
   - Any tradeoffs I should know about
   - What I'll need to sign up for (accounts, services, etc.)

3. **Outline the steps** — Walk me through what's going to happen before you start. I want to understand the process, not just watch it happen.

4. **Wait for my go-ahead** — Don't start deploying until I approve the plan.

When you deploy:
- Tell me when you need me to do something (create an account, click a link, verify something)
- Explain any credentials or keys I need to save
- Test that it actually works before saying we're done

When it's live, give me:
- The link to access my project
- How to check if it's still running
- How to update it when I make changes
- How to take it down if I need to
- Any costs I should expect or watch out for

Assume I've never deployed anything before. No step is too obvious to explain.
