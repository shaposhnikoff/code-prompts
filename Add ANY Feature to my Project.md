I have a working project and I want to add a new feature to it. I'm not a developer, so I need you to handle the code and explain things in plain language.

Here's what my project currently does:
[Describe your project briefly — what it is, what it does now]

Here's the feature I want to add:
[Describe what you want the new feature to do — be as specific as you can]

Before you touch anything:

1. **Explore my project** — Look through my files and understand how things are currently built. Don't make any changes yet.

2. **Confirm you understand** — Tell me in simple terms:
   - How my project is currently structured
   - Where the new feature would fit in
   - What files you'll need to modify or create

3. **Flag any concerns** — Let me know if:
   - The feature might break something that already works
   - My project needs cleanup before adding this
   - The feature is more complex than I might realize
   - There's a simpler version we could start with

4. **Propose your plan** — Walk me through:
   - What you're going to build
   - The steps you'll take (in order)
   - What it will look like when it's done

5. **Wait for my approval** — Don't start until I say go.

When you build:
- Make small changes and test after each one
- If something breaks, stop and tell me before continuing
- Explain what you're doing as you go

When you're done:
- Show me how to use the new feature
- Point out anything I should know about maintaining it
- Let me know if there are related improvements we could make next

Treat my existing project with care — I don't want to break what's already working.
